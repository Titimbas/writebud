# WRITEBUD
 A text editor built using Python (libraries such as tkinter and some APIs were heavily used), with the intetion of helping with the focus and concentration of neurodivergent users (mainly focused on ADHD)
 
 Writebud is the main application developed (initially) as part of my final thesis on College, and turned into one of the motives for me to come back to program regularly, a habit that I unfortunately lost during the pandemic, among other things that kept me from proper code form. 
 
 Writebud is completely made in Python, using the tkinter library for the GUI creation and manipulation. The main thought of the app was to offer a nicer experience to all the users who have a rough time concentrating on notetaking tasks, may it be for the excess of information from the lots of tools available on the newest text editor apps, or from the lots of information from the interface. 
 
 It has a focus mode (basically fullscreen), and several tools thought to keep all user interaction within the focus mode.
